For Proposition 1; 
Before running this code, adjust a random permutation value in the "double compute_divisor()" section according to your desired j using the formula from Remark 1 in the paper.

For Theorem 1;
Before running this code, adjust a random permutation value in the "double compute_divisor()" section according to your desired j using the formula from Remark 1 in the paper.

For Theorem 2;
Using the code in this section, you can compute the values of $P^6_{m,2}$ for your chosen m values. Then, using the code in the Corollary1 file, find the corresponding Pr[m\rightarrow _6 3] ratio for the same m values. Finally, apply the formula given in Theorem 2 to calculate $Pr[m\rightarrow _6 2]$ for each m.
