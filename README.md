For Proposition 1; 
Before running this code, adjust a random permutation value in the "double compute_divisor()" section according to your desired j using the formula from Remark 1 in the paper.

For Theorem 1;
Before running this code, adjust a random permutation value in the "double compute_divisor()" section according to your desired j using the formula from Remark 1 in the paper.

For Corollary 1;
Before running this code, adjust a random permutation value in the "double compute_divisor()" section according to your desired j using the formula 
(2^{32j-126})*((1-2^{-32})^{j})*((1-2^{-128})^{-1}).

For Theorem 2;
Using the code in this section, you can compute the values of for your chosen
